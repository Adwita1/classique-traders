<div class="title"> About Classique </div>
<div class="subtext"> Operating in close co-operation with both architects and builders right from the start of the project, Classique & Co. is dedicated to ensuring on-time delivery. Our well-trained and experienced teams of stonemasons and ceramic tillers, working under the direct supervision of our own site managers, enable us to complete all projects as planned - on time and within budget.</div>
<div class="subtext"> We at Classique & Co, are convinced that our ongoing success and continuing expansion is directly due to our attention to detail and our constant commitment to excellence. Completed projects on which the company has worked are testimony to this claim. Our case studies are but a few examples of our recent work.</div>
